# Commerce

This web app is built with Django and Python. It allows users to create and edit auction listings simulating an Ebay style site. In addition, the site allows users to post comments, bid and close bids. The site dynamically creates listings storing them in relational databases and has a search function in built which accesses those databases. As this is a dynamic site, I don't have it hosted currently so please feel free to review the code or watch my video explanation. 

This was made as part of CS50's 2021 Web Development course.
